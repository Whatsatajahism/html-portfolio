<h1>The best films of all time according to Tajah</h1>
<h2>Yes, I truly believe this, no, I will not be taking any questions at this time.</h2>

<h3>Everything Everywhere All At Once<br />
     (2022)<br /> </h3>
<p>There was absolutely no question that this would be top of the list. Breaking generational curses, dealing with queerness in the diaspora, and amazing fight scenes? There was only one way this could go.</p>

<h3>Cidade de Deus<br /> 
    (2002)<br /> </h3>
<p>A beautiful brazilian film set in the favelas of Rio. It was the film of a generation, it gave Black kids across the world a film that centred them, while also highlighting the harsh realities of economic inequality. It was also one of the first times I had heard Brazilian Portuguese, and so for the nostalgia of that alone, it makes the list.</p>

<h3>Spiderman: Across the Spiderverse<br />
    (2023)<br /> </h3>
<p>Look, Miles Morales can do no wrong. But, can we have a moment for the animation real quick? The colours, the vibrancy, the hidden queer messages? It was a stunning film accompanied by a stupendous soundtrack. No notes, just applause. </p>
